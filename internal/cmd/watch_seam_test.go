// TestWatchForChangesRunsLoop drives watchForChanges in a temp dir with no
// gothic-config.json, so both rebuild() calls return early (config error) and
// never shell out. With no src/ directory, filepath.Walk("src") errors and the
// second rebuild() branch is exercised. The watcher is set up on ".", and a
// .go file write feeds one pass through the select loop, which routes the
// event to handleWatchEvent -> scheduleRebuild and arms the debounce timer.
//
// The test asserts that the debounce timer was armed within a bounded poll
// window (rather than asserting nothing after fixed sleeps). This proves the
// watcher actually delivered the event and the loop scheduled a rebuild — if
// the watcher silently dropped every event, the timer would stay nil and the
// test would fail. The function blocks on select afterward, so it runs in a
// goroutine the test does not join (the fsnotify watcher is GC-finalized at
// process exit), mirroring the watch/reaper-goroutine test style in this
// package.
